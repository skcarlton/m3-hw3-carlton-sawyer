I wasn't exactly sure how to style text with the variables so I tried to keep it simple. I had trouble trying to center the images into their respective column and was not sure how to make that happen, so they might seem a little left justified. Also, I will definitely need to practice mixins a little more to be effective using them, but I just tried to do the best I could with my first time. Other than the natural learning curve, no issues. I refered to https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/ and the live lecture as resources for this assignment.
